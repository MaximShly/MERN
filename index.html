                <p>🖥️ As a Full Stack Developer, I've had the privilege of assisting multiple startups in designing and deploying their digital platforms. From the ground up, I've seen ideas come to life on the web, and I'm passionate about every layer of modern web applications. 📚 Recently, I've taken my dedication a step further by completing the MIT Full Stack Development Certificate </p>

        <p>🍽️ Prior to diving deep into the tech world, I served in the high-paced atmosphere of elite restaurants. Notably, I've worked at Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen, where I was not just a part of the culinary extravaganza but also handpicked to train and spearhead teams at the debut of Hell's Kitchen — the first one Gordon personally launched.

🚀 Today, I merge the precision and rigor of my culinary past with my tech expertise, aspiring to create impeccable digital experiences. As I continue my journey, I'm eager to further hone my skills and collaborate on transformative projects.</p>
