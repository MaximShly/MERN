# Real-Time Eye Movement Animation
The JavaScript code creates an animated simulation of human eyes that follow the movement of the cursor on the screen. As the cursor moves, two circular elements (representing pupils) will shift their positions to look in the direction of the cursor, creating an effect of eyes watching the cursor.

## How to run:
Download the files locally.
Ensure all files are in the same folder.
Open the index.html file with any web browser.
Move your cursor around the screen, and observe the "eyes" following the cursor.
To reset the eyes to their initial state, simply refresh the page.

## Future Improvements:
Add eyelids that blink periodically.
Integrate smooth transitions for more realistic eye movements.
Allow customization of eye color, size, and shape.
