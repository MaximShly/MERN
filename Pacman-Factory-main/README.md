# Pacmen Factory Animation
The JavaScript code creates a fun representation of a factory producing PacMan characters that bounce around the screen. As PacMen are produced, they move in random directions, and upon hitting the edge of the window, they reverse direction, creating an effect of bouncing PacMen.

## How to run:
Download the files locally.
Ensure all files are in the same folder.
Open the index.html file with any web browser.
Initiate the production of PacMen by triggering the appropriate function/event.
The PacMen will begin moving around and will change direction upon hitting the window boundaries.

## Future Improvements:
Implement PacMan mouth opening and closing animations while moving.
Add sound effects when PacMen bounce off the edges.
Allow customization of PacMan colors and sizes.
